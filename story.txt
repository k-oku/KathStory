 harles J Hoffman is quite the hipster, self-titled "friendly bacon guru" and "professional zombie fanatic". Also a shit writer if you ask me. One morning while Charles was having his vegemite on toast, he noticed something peculiar.
Mr Hoffman always included the latest issue of People's magazine as an instrumental part of his daily routine, but today it was missing. Hoffman, dying to find out what will happen with Jordyn Woods, took matters into his own hands by buying a ticket to California to track the story down himself. His journey would prove to feed his lust for bacon as well...
